A script which makes you a Raspberry Pi just the way you want it

**EXAMPLE:** [Watch the recording of my terminal](http://ascii.io/a/4525)

## What it does

I was tired of doing all these steps manually, so I automated the whole process:

- Downloads a Raspbian Wheezy OS image file if you don't have one already
- Writes the OS image onto the SD card
- Configures the raspi's SSH credentials, including authorizing your own key so you can do key-based login
- Makes some common, convenient aliases:
   - `ls` (ls -GF)
   - `ll` (ls -Glh)
   - `la` (ls -Glha)
   - `echoip` (shows raspi's external IP address)
   - `locip` (shows raspi's local IP address)
   - `temp` (shows the CPU temperature)
- Installs:
   - `htop` (a better process viewer)
   - `expect` (for automating terminal tasks)
   - `screen` (terminal window multiplexer)
   - `usbmount` (optional; automatically mounts/unmounts USB flash drives)
   - `lynx` (optional; text web browser)
- Sets the time zone
- Configures wifi (if you want)
- Changes the default password (if you want)
- Runs a one-time provisioning script with any custom commands as you please
- Resizes the root filesystem to expand to the whole available size of the SD card

If you want to use the latest firmware on your card, you can add `sudo rpi-update` to your
provisioning script.


## How it works

It's almost all automated. Just configure the script, insert an SD card, run the script, and follow
the instructions. The terminal will bell when it needs your attention.



## How to make your Raspberry Pi

I hope you have a Mac, because I don't think this script will run on Windows or Linux. Oops! (Contribute?)


### Preparation

1. Clone down this repository (or [download the ZIP file](https://github.com/mholt/makemypi/archive/master.zip)).
2. Create or copy the public and private key pair belonging to your Raspberry Pi into the "transfer" folder.
   Call the files `id_rsa` for the private key, and `id_rsa.pub` for the public key.
3. Rename [transfer/config_template.sh](https://github.com/mholt/makemypi/blob/master/transfer/config_template.sh)
   to `config.sh` and change the settings as needed.
4. Make sure your own public key is in `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. Either that, or configure the `AuthorizedPubKey` variable
   with your actual public key string. This will let you log in with your own private key.
5. You can add your own custom setup steps if you want. Just use
   [transfer/provision_template.sh](https://github.com/mholt/makemypi/blob/master/transfer/provision_template.sh).

### Running the script

1. In Terminal, `cd` into the directory containing [makemypi.sh](https://github.com/mholt/makemypi/blob/master/makemypi.sh).
2. `chmod +x makemypi.sh`
3. Plug in your SD card
4. `sudo ./makemypi.sh [imgFile]`
   
   The optional parameter, `[imgFile]`, is a path to the .img file to write onto the SD card.
   If you don't specify one, the script can download and extract the image file for you.




## More details

Files in the "transfer" folder get copied to the Raspberry Pi during the setup, but all the setup
files are removed once the setup is complete.

Use [transfer/provision_template.sh](https://github.com/mholt/makemypi/blob/master/transfer/provision_template.sh)
by renaming it to `provision.sh` and writing your own provisioning script. Those commands will only be run once,
near the end of the setup process, just before expanding the root filesystem to fill the SD card and rebooting.
(So you'll have more limited space than you might expect.)

Of course, this whole thing is open source, so you can change any part of the script you want. Feel free to fork
the project if you need to do it differently, or submit pull requests with bug fixes and improvements.


## Disclaimer

This script uses dd and some other "volatile" commands. I assume no responsibility if anything goes wrong
on your end. It works on my machine, but I don't know if it will work on yours. Sorry.
But have fun, and enjoy your Pi!
